  <h2>What is GeckoGraph?</h2>
  <p>
    GeckoGraph is a visual notation for type annotations in statically typed programming languages. It is intended to work tangibly with text-based annotations, but uses colors, shapes, and symbols to make structures of types easy to identify at a glance.
  </p>

  <h2>Why GeckoGraph?</h2>
  <h3>Easy to learn</h3>
  GeckoGraph should take little to no effort to learn. The rules to translate a text-based type notation to GeckoGraph should be minimal. Where possible, GeckoGraph should be intuitive to programmers who are familiar with text-based type notation.

  <h3>Easy to parse by humans</h3>
  GeckoGraph should make the task of reading and understanding type notation easy. It should emphasize the less obvious properties of a type signature. GeckoGraph should eliminate the need for mental backtracking, such as counting opening and closing parentheses and remembering which type classes are required on which variables.

  <h3>Optimized for comparing and searching</h3>
GeckoGraph should aim to make the task of comparing two types easy, especially to make subtle differences in text-based notation harder to miss. This also includes the task of choosing an ideal function from a list of potential functions. For example, programmers search for a desired function from a documentation site with only partial knowledge of its type (e.g., the arity of a function, containing a known type, or type classes requirements).
